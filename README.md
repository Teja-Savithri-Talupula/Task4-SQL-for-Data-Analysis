Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis â€“ Northwind Database

ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this task is to use SQL queries to extract and analyze data from the Northwind sample database.
This includes data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, creating views, and query optimization using indexes.

ðŸ›  Tools & Environment
Database: MySQL (Northwind dataset)

Tools Used: MySQL Workbench
Dataset: Northwind Database (Customers, Orders, Order_Details tables)

ðŸ“Š Queries Performed
1. View All Data
2. Filtering Records (WHERE)
3. Sorting & Filtering with Conditions
4. Aggregation (SUM, GROUP BY, ORDER BY)
5. Joins
INNER JOIN
LEFT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN
6. Subquery Example
7. Average Order Value per Customer
8. Revenue by Country
9. Create View
10. Index Creation for Optimization
11. Query Performance Check (EXPLAIN)


ðŸ“ˆ Key Learnings

Used SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY for data extraction and organization.
Applied INNER, LEFT, RIGHT JOIN to combine tables.
Implemented subqueries for advanced filtering.
Used aggregate functions (SUM, AVG) for numerical analysis.
Created a View for high-value orders to simplify future queries.
Improved query performance using indexes and validated with EXPLAIN.
